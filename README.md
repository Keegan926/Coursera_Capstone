Geospatial Analysis Project, guided by IBM's Professional Certificate in Data Science.

The project demonstrates a machine learning analysis of geospatial data leveraging Foursquare's API to aggregate location data.

  The Jupyter Notebook in this repository demonstrates the comparison of Manhattan and Toronto performed by characterizing neighborboods by the types of venues contained, as retrieved by Foursquare's API. The relative frequencies of each venue type are clustered to determine the similarity of the neighborhoods analyzed in order to provide a hypothetical client with actionable data.
